# data-analysis-DivvyBikes-Python

# Introduction â€¨
Bicycle-sharing systems have become increasingly popular in big cities, offering the public a convenient and flexible transportation option for short-distance trips. Among these systems is Divvy Bikes, serving Chicagoland by providing residents and visitors with an affordable and enjoyable way to explore and navigate Chicago and Evanston.

Divvy operates with a network of specially-designed, robust bikes that are securely docked at various stations throughout the region. Users can easily unlock a bike from one station and return it to any other station within the system. Becoming an Annual Member or purchasing a Pass through the Divvy station kiosk or the Divvy App grants individuals access to the service.

The versatility of bike share systems like Divvy makes them ideal for various purposes, including leisurely exploration, commuting to work or school, running errands, attending appointments, and engaging in social activities. Divvy remains accessible at all times, 24/7, 365 days a year, offering riders the freedom to use any bike and station within the extensive system.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical trip data of Divvy Bikes and is available for public use. It was downloaded from the official Divvy Bikes website (https://divvybikes.com/system-data) and is released on a monthly schedule. The dataset is provided under the terms of the Divvy Data License Agreement.

File Name: Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv

### Dataset Details:

Total Rows: 365,069
Total Columns: 12
### Column Information:

* Trip ID: A unique identifier for each trip record in the dataset.
* Start Time: The timestamp indicating the start time of the trip.
* End Time: The timestamp indicating the end time of the trip.
* Start Station ID: An ID representing the bike station where the trip started.
* Start Station Name: The name of the bike station where the trip started.
* End Station ID: An ID representing the bike station where the trip ended.
* End Station Name: The name of the bike station where the trip ended.
* User Type: Indicates whether the user is an annual membership holder ("subscriber") or a one-day pass holder ("customer").
* Gender: The gender of the user (if available).
* Birth Year: The birth year of the user (if available).

Note: Some users may not have provided gender or birth year information, resulting in missing values in the corresponding columns.

# Data Preparation

In this project, various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, datetime, and calendar will be utilized for data analysis. The dataset will undergo a cleansing process to ensure integrity and comprehensibility. Errors, wrong data types, and missing values will be addressed, and new columns will be added to facilitate analysis.

### Initial observations reveal:

* No duplicate rows in the dataset.
* Null values in the 'gender' (19711 entries) and 'birthyear' (18023 entries) columns.
* 'start_time' and 'end_time' columns are in object data type, and they will be converted to date format to extract useful date information.
* The 'tripduration' column has some data issues. The data type will be changed to integer, and values with separators (",") will be removed.
* Some trip durations are extremely long (up to 2952 hours), likely due to errors or unreturned bikes. These will be replaced with the mean duration of trips less than three hours.
* The 'gender' column will be filled with "Missing" for null values, and "Missing" values will be disregarded during analysis.
* The 'birthyear' column will be used to create the 'user_age' column, and extreme ages (above 80) will be replaced with the average age (41).
* Null values in the 'user_age' column will be filled with the average user age (41) to retain valuable data.

By performing these data preparation steps, the dataset will be ready for further analysis, enabling meaningful insights into city-wide biking trends during the first quarter of 2019.


# Data Insights

After cleaning and preparing the dataset, valuable insights have been derived from the analysis:
### Number of Divvy Trips, Most Used Bikes and Average Trip Duration

* Number of Divvy Trips: During the first quarter of 2019, a total of 365,069 Divvy trips were completed.

* Most Used Bikes: Among the fleet of Divvy bikes, the following bike IDs were the most frequently used for trips: 3457, 6407, 5983, 6074, and 3494. These bikes were utilized for a significant number of rides during the quarter.

* Average Trip Duration: The mean trip duration for all users during the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 12 minutes. However, when considering user types separately:

    * Subscription Riders: The average trip duration for subscription riders was around 11 minutes, which is lower than the overall mean trip duration.
    * Casual Riders: Casual riders, who hold one-day passes, had an average trip duration of approximately 31 minutes, which is significantly higher than the overall mean trip duration. This indicates that casual riders tend to use the bikes for longer durations compared to subscribers.

### Popular Start and End Stations and Popular Trip Routes

* Popular Start Stations: The "from_station_name" column was used to identify the most popular start stations for Divvy trips. The station with the highest number of trips originating from it is the "Clinton St & Washington Blvd" station, with a total of 7,699 trips.

* Popular End Stations: Similarly, the "to_station_name" column was analyzed to determine the most popular end stations for Divvy trips. Interestingly, the "Clinton St & Washington Blvd" station is also the most popular end station, with 7,699 trips concluding at this location.

* Popular Trip Routes: By grouping the "from_station_name" and "to_station_name" columns together, the most popular trip routes taken by Divvy users were identified. The route from "Michigan Ave & Washington St" station to "Clinton St & Washington Blvd" station emerged as the most popular route, with a total of 513 trips.

### Cyclical Pattern in Each Hour and Each Day

The analysis of the dataset reveals interesting cyclical patterns in Divvy Bikes usage by hour and by day, which provide valuable insights for resource management and operational adjustments.

#### Cyclical Pattern By Hour:

   * Peak Hours: Divvy bikes are most heavily utilized during the afternoon hours, with two peak periods at 5 pm and 4 pm, recording 49,968 and 39,270 trips, respectively. Additionally, in the morning, there are peak periods at 8 am and 7 am, with 37,930 and 27,218 trips, respectively. These peak times suggest that users frequently use Divvy Bikes for their commute to and from work. These commuting hours demonstrate the high demand for bike-sharing services as an efficient mode of transportation during rush hours.
   * Lowest Usage Hours: The usage of Divvy Bikes is relatively low during the late-night and early morning hours, from midnight to 5 am. During this period, the number of trips declines significantly, indicating minimal bike usage during these hours.

#### Cyclical Pattern by Day:

   * Weekdays vs. Weekends: Analyzing the "day_of_week" column reveals that weekdays (Monday to Friday) exhibit relatively similar numbers of trips, showing minimal variation between each day. Thursday records the highest number of trips, with a total of 66,903. This suggests consistent bike usage during weekdays, likely for work and daily activities.
   * Weekend Usage: On Saturdays and Sundays, the number of trips decreases significantly. Saturdays have 35,302 trips, and Sundays have 27,999 trips, representing a 50% reduction in trips compared to weekdays. The lower usage during the weekend indicates a shift in biking behavior, where fewer people rely on bike-sharing services for work-related commutes, and the demand is more leisure-oriented.
