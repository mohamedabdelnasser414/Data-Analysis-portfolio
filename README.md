# Introduction â€¨
Bicycle-sharing systems have become increasingly popular in big cities, offering the public a convenient and flexible transportation option for short-distance trips. Among these systems is Divvy Bikes, serving Chicagoland by providing residents and visitors with an affordable and enjoyable way to explore and navigate Chicago and Evanston.

Divvy operates with a network of specially-designed, robust bikes that are securely docked at various stations throughout the region. Users can easily unlock a bike from one station and return it to any other station within the system. Becoming an Annual Member or purchasing a Pass through the Divvy station kiosk or the Divvy App grants individuals access to the service.

The versatility of bike share systems like Divvy makes them ideal for various purposes, including leisurely exploration, commuting to work or school, running errands, attending appointments, and engaging in social activities. Divvy remains accessible at all times, 24/7, 365 days a year, offering riders the freedom to use any bike and station within the extensive system.
